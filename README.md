# JoDeFu

Matlab implementation of the "multiresolution compressed acquisition" (MRCA) image formation and "joint demosaicing and fusion" (JoDeFu) image reconstruction methods.

The code is capable to:
- model an optical acquisition device based on color filter arrays (CFAs) and/or multiresolution sensors;
- estimate an image datacube from their acquisition;
- compare the results of the estimated products with respect to classical demosaicing and sharpening algorithms.
